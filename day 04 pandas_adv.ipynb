[SPEC 4](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0004/)), so I figured we'd raise here for awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an instance of in-place assignment to `df.values` in the NX examples that has begun failing with the pandas nightly wheels:\\r\\n\\r\\n### On latest stable from pypi (2.2.1)\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> import numpy as np\\r\\n>>> import pandas as pd\\r\\n>>> pd.__version__\\r\\n'2.2.1'\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.eye(2), index=[1, 2], columns=[1, 2])\\r\\n>>> df.values[np.diag_indices_from(df)] *= 2\\r\\n>>> df\\r\\n     1    2\\r\\n1  2.0  0.0\\r\\n2  0.0  2.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### On nightly wheels\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> import numpy as np\\r\\n>>> import pandas as pd\\r\\n>>> pd.__version__\\r\\n'3.0.0.dev0+444.gaabc35abe0'\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.eye(2), index=[1, 2], columns=[1, 2])\\r\\n>>> df.values[np.diag_indices_from(df)] *= 2\\r\\nTraceback (most recent call last)\\r\\n   ...\\r\\nValueError: assignment destination is read-only\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI assume the actual behavior change is expected as part of pandas-3.0; my goal was to raise awareness that there is no `FutureWarning`/`DeprecationWarning` for the assigning-to-values in the current version of pandas. It may be that this is intentional - if so, please close this issue! FWIW we have caught and fixed [other issues in the NX test suite](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7209) via deprecation/future warnings.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\nVersion info included above. Additional context - I tried the same minimal example with a 2.3 dev nightly wheel (`2.3.0.dev0+34.g0c23e18c73`) and no warnings were raised there either.\",\n",

While the error is, in core, thrown by `fastparquet` I report it here since its directly related to the upcoming changes in `pandas`\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nSee example above - it is expected that the data loads back in as it is with the old settings of `CoW`\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : f538741432edf55c6b9fb5d0d496d2dd1d7c2457\\r\\npython                : 3.11.4.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 140 Stepping 1, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en\\r\\nLOCALE                : de_DE.cp1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.24.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.2.1\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.0\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.2.6\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.1.9\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.17.2\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.10.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.1\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.57.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.1\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : 3.8.0\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

When I use the python engine I see that the leading zeros are still there as expected.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI would expect when treating all columns as strings that the leading zeros are retained and the data is unmodified.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.11.8.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.5.0-17-generic\\r\\nVersion               : #17-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jan 11 14:20:13 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

I know there has been some relevant discussion in #49543.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what the correct behavior is here.  A simple and easily explainable behavior would be to always respect `as_index=False`. However, to be consistent with the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#transformation), transform-like applies should never respect `as_index=False`, and I suppose that non-transform-like applies should respect it:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Since transformations do not include the groupings that are used to split the result, the arguments as_index and sort in [DataFrame.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html#pandas.DataFrame.groupby) and [Series.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.groupby.html#pandas.Series.groupby) have no effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen `group_keys=True`, the result **does** include the \"groupings that are used to split the result\", so for the same reason that this note gives, `as_index` should have no effect. The current behavior is the opposite, though: `as_index` has an effect only when `group_keys=True`. (despite the description of [group_keys](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html), it appears that `apply` includes the group keys in the index if and only if `group_keys=False`, regardless of whether `func` is a transform.)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.9.18.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.3.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:31:00 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

[SPEC 4](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0004/)), so I figured we'd raise here for awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an instance of in-place assignment to `df.values` in the NX examples that has begun failing with the pandas nightly wheels:\\r\\n\\r\\n### On latest stable from pypi (2.2.1)\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> import numpy as np\\r\\n>>> import pandas as pd\\r\\n>>> pd.__version__\\r\\n'2.2.1'\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.eye(2), index=[1, 2], columns=[1, 2])\\r\\n>>> df.values[np.diag_indices_from(df)] *= 2\\r\\n>>> df\\r\\n     1    2\\r\\n1  2.0  0.0\\r\\n2  0.0  2.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### On nightly wheels\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> import numpy as np\\r\\n>>> import pandas as pd\\r\\n>>> pd.__version__\\r\\n'3.0.0.dev0+444.gaabc35abe0'\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.eye(2), index=[1, 2], columns=[1, 2])\\r\\n>>> df.values[np.diag_indices_from(df)] *= 2\\r\\nTraceback (most recent call last)\\r\\n   ...\\r\\nValueError: assignment destination is read-only\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI assume the actual behavior change is expected as part of pandas-3.0; my goal was to raise awareness that there is no `FutureWarning`/`DeprecationWarning` for the assigning-to-values in the current version of pandas. It may be that this is intentional - if so, please close this issue! FWIW we have caught and fixed [other issues in the NX test suite](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/7209) via deprecation/future warnings.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\nVersion info included above. Additional context - I tried the same minimal example with a 2.3 dev nightly wheel (`2.3.0.dev0+34.g0c23e18c73`) and no warnings were raised there either.\",\n",

I did notice that with the `on` `kwarg`, I get an error that might indicate this is not allowed:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\njoin_df.join([cat_df], on=\\'y\\')\\r\\n```\\r\\ngives\\r\\n```python\\r\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\r\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\r\\n  File \"/Users/ilangold/Projects/Theis/pandas/pandas/core/frame.py\", line 10463, in join\\r\\n    raise ValueError(\\r\\nValueError: Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\nNot sure what\\'s up with the installed version commit since my `git log` looks like\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\ncommit e14a9bd41d8cd8ac52c5c958b735623fe0eae064 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)\\r\\nAuthor: Eric Larson <larson.eric.d@gmail.com>\\r\\nDate:   Wed Feb 28 17:21:32 2024 -0500\\r\\n\\r\\n    ENH: Report how far off the formatting is (#57667)\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 52cb549f443f09727448251cfee53227c6bca9d2\\r\\npython                : 3.11.6.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 22.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 22.6.0: Wed Oct  4 21:26:23 PDT 2023; root:xnu-8796.141.3.701.17~4/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+87.g52cb549f44.dirty\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.8\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.2\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.98.13\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.2.6\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.22.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.2.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.6\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.2.0\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.27\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.2.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

I know there has been some relevant discussion in #49543.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what the correct behavior is here.  A simple and easily explainable behavior would be to always respect `as_index=False`. However, to be consistent with the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#transformation), transform-like applies should never respect `as_index=False`, and I suppose that non-transform-like applies should respect it:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Since transformations do not include the groupings that are used to split the result, the arguments as_index and sort in [DataFrame.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html#pandas.DataFrame.groupby) and [Series.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.groupby.html#pandas.Series.groupby) have no effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen `group_keys=True`, the result **does** include the \"groupings that are used to split the result\", so for the same reason that this note gives, `as_index` should have no effect. The current behavior is the opposite, though: `as_index` has an effect only when `group_keys=True`. (despite the description of [group_keys](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html), it appears that `apply` includes the group keys in the index if and only if `group_keys=False`, regardless of whether `func` is a transform.)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : bdc79c146c2e32f2cab629be240f01658cfb6cc2\\r\\npython                : 3.9.18.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.3.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:31:00 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.1\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
